  <p>Despite latest surge in popularity future of film photography is uncertain. I documented most popular homemade development solution recipes and calculated proportions of chemicals needed so any amount of any chemical can be measured accordingly. For more information on development <a href="#further-reading">check out further reading</a>.</p>

<h1 id="rodiynal">Rodiynal</h1>
<p>Rodinal is oldest and most common development solution for black and white film but it is getting harder to find labs to develop black and white film for a reasonable price. This recipe doesn&rsquo;t differ much from famous <a href="//www.drfrankenfilm.com/diy-rodinal/4575179217">Dr. Frankenfilm&rsquo;s Homebrew Rodinal</a> article - be sure to check Dr. Frankenfilm&rsquo;s instructions for more detail and video.</p>
<h3 id="for-input-typenumber-value250-idamount_rodinalml-of-rodiynal-youll-need">For <input type="number" value="250" id="amount_rodinal">ml of Rodiynal you&rsquo;ll need:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="rodinal_water"></span> + <span class="rodinal_water_extra"></span> Distilled Water - available in most modest sized retail stores household chemistry section;</li>
<li><span class="rodinal_sodium_sulfite"></span> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_sulfite">Sodium Sulfite</a> - available in swimming pool shops or easily available from your local chemist. This is mostly safe but may cause allergy and asthma if ingested;</li>
<li><span class="rodinal_sodium_hydroxide"></span> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide">Sodium Hydroxide</a> - lye is available in most hardware or retail store&rsquo;s chemistry section as drain cleaner. Please handle this carefully as it will cause damage to your skin and eyes if handled poorly;</li>
<li><span class="rodinal_acetominophen"></span> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol">Acetominophen 500mg</a> - available in most pharmacies as <em>Paracetamol</em>/<em>Tylenol 500mg</em> or generic pain killer. You&rsquo;ll need to pulverize it before use;</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheapest ingredient versions will contain less additives and will make better end product. Distilled water can be substituted with boiled water but will contain less than beneficial sediments and impurities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to prepare kitchen scales, measuring cup, disposable mixing spoon/stick and air-tight dark bottle to hold Rodinal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mixing-rodiynal">Mixing Rodiynal</h3>
<p>I prefer to measure, prepare and order my chemicals in succession before mixing. Be sure to mix chemicals in correct order. Handle chemicals carefully - even harmless ones will teach you to be careful.</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure <span class="rodinal_water"></span> of distilled water into a measuring cup;</li>
<li>Stir <span class="rodinal_sodium_sulfite"></span> of Sodium Sulfite into water. Remaining sediments will dissolve later;</li>
<li>Carefully measure out <span class="rodinal_sodium_hydroxide"></span> of Sodium Hydroxide (Lye) and stir it into water until dissolved. This will begin reaction and increase temperature of the liquid;</li>
<li>Pulverize <span class="rodinal_acetominophen_tablets"></span> tablets and pour it into the mixture while it&rsquo;s still warm - stir until completely dissolved. Some sediments are normal;</li>
<li>Add more water to make desired amount of Rodinal;</li>
<li>Transfer liquid into light tight bottle, cap it off and let it react for at least 72 hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;d advise to mix Rodinal before every use to stir up sediments. Store Rodinal in a dark, air-tight bottle away from children. Follow your film instructions as normal Rodinal.</p>

<h1 id="stop-solution">Stop solution</h1>
<p>Stop bath solution is used in normal development and darkroom but can be omitted for stand development.</p>
<p>According to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_bath">Wikipedia</a> a stop bath solution should be 1-2% acetic acid or commonly available as white vinegar. White vinegar is available in different concentrations from 5%-30% therefore we will need to dilute our vinegar with room temperature boiled water.</p>
<h3 id="for-input-typenumber-value250-idamount_stopml-of-stop-bath-from-input-typenumber-value30-idvinegar_percent-white-vinegar-concentrate-you-will-need">For <input type="number" value="250" id="amount_stop">ml of stop bath from <input type="number" value="30" id="vinegar_percent">% white vinegar concentrate you will need:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="stop_water"></span> of room temperature distilled water - by this point can be substituted with room temperature boiled water;</li>
<li><span class="stop_vinegar"></span> of white vinegar - available in most grocery stores. One can find concentration% of vinegar on the bottle;</li>
</ul>
<p>Just mix the ingredients in room temperature. Formula is easy enough to make when necessary.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="fixer">Fixer</h1>
<p>Recipes can vary wildly - <a href="//www.flickr.com/groups/67377471@N00/discuss/72157671992973893/">Flickr</a> has several formulas from its users, <a href="//www.as.uky.edu/blogs/dlro223/dont-be-fooled-household-items-can-be-used-film-developers">College of Arts and sciences</a> has recipes for fixing in Caffenol and Vitamin C. I went with the simplest safe recipe; others might use different chemistry to fix quicker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest mixing it as necessary because I didnt find reliable shelf life time. Some say it varies from 60 days to half a year.</p>
<h3 id="for-input-typenumber-value1000-idamount_fixerml-of-fixer-youll-need">For <input type="number" value="1000" id="amount_fixer">ml of Fixer you&rsquo;ll need:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="fixer_water"></span> distilled water cooled to ~52Â°C;</li>
<li><span class="fixer_thiosulfate"></span> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_thiosulfate">Sodium Thiosulfate</a> - available from local pool store or local chemist;</li>
<li><span class="fixer_sodium_sulfite"></span> <a href="c1">Sodium Sulfite</a> - same as we used for <a href="#rodiynal">Rodiynal</a>;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mixing-fixer">Mixing fixer</h3>
<ol>
<li><span class="fixer_water"></span> distilled water into measuring cup;</li>
<li>Add <span class="fixer_thiosulfate"></span> Sodium Thiosulfate - the solution will become cold - that is normal;</li>
<li>Mix in <span class="fixer_sodium_sulfite"></span> of Sodium Sulfite until it dissolves;</li>
<li>Transfer solution into a <span class="fixer_volume"></span> bottle and add more water to make desired amount;</li>
<li>Fixer should be left to react for about 24 hours before intended use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Spent fixer can be reused for up to ten rolls of 1L solution. Fixer should be used in room temperature and agitated for 5-10 minutes - more if it is not fresh.</p>
<h3 id="disposal-of-fixer">Disposal of fixer</h3>
<p>Fixer should not be discarded in municipal sewer system due to silver content from fixing film. <a href="//goldrefiningforum.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=20362">It is possible to extract silver from spent Fixer</a>. Some photo laboratories, universities, chemists or hazardous waste management facilities might accept exhausted liquid.</p>
