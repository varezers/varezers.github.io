Ceropegia woodii is a beautiful, low-maintenance plant that can add a whimsical touch to your indoor or outdoor space.

Light: Ceropegia woodii prefers bright, indirect light. Avoid placing it in direct sunlight, as this can scorch the leaves.

Water: Ceropegia woodii prefers well-draining soil and infrequent watering. Allow the soil to dry out slightly before watering, and be careful not to overwater as this can lead to root rot.

Soil: Ceropegia woodii prefers a well-draining soil mix, such as a mix of potting soil, perlite, and sand.

Fertilizer: You can fertilize Ceropegia woodii with a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).

Propagation: Ceropegia woodii can be propagated by stem cuttings or tubers.

Pruning: Prune your Ceropegia woodii to control its size and shape. Pinch back the tips of the vines to encourage branching and fuller growth.

Pests and diseases: Ceropegia woodii is relatively pest and disease-free. However, watch out for mealybugs, spider mites, and scale insects. You can treat these problems with insecticidal soap or neem oil.

Propagation:
* Stem cuttings: Take stem cuttings from a healthy Ceropegia woodii plant. Cut a few stems to the desired length, making sure each cutting has at least two leaves. Allow the cuttings to dry for a day or two, then dip the cut end of the stem in rooting hormone and plant the cutting in a pot with well-draining soil. Keep the soil moist and place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After a few weeks, roots should start to grow from the stem cutting. Once the roots are well-established, you can transplant the new plant to a larger pot or to the garden.
* Tuber division: Ceropegia woodii produces tubers that can be divided to create new plants. Carefully dig up the plant and gently separate the tubers, making sure each division has a few roots attached. Plant each division in a pot with well-draining soil and keep the soil moist. Place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After a few weeks, new growth should start to emerge from the tubers.
