Light: Aloe vera prefers bright, indirect sunlight. However, it can also tolerate low light conditions.

Water: Water your Aloe vera deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can cause root rot, so be sure not to let the plant sit in standing water.

Soil: Aloe vera prefers well-draining soil. You can use a commercial cactus mix or a mixture of sand, perlite, and potting soil.

Temperature: Aloe vera prefers warm temperatures between 60째F and 75째F (15째C to 24째C).

Fertilizer: You can fertilize your Aloe vera with a balanced fertilizer once every few months during the growing season (spring and summer).

Pruning: Prune your Aloe vera to remove any dead or damaged leaves and to control its size and shape.

Propagation:
* Pups: One of the easiest ways to propagate Aloe vera is by using its offsets, also known as "pups." When your Aloe vera plant produces offsets, wait until they are about one-third the size of the parent plant before removing them. Gently remove the pup from the parent plant and let the wound callus over for a day or two. Then plant the pup in a small pot with well-draining soil and water it lightly. Wait a few weeks for the roots to establish before transplanting the new plant to a larger pot.
* Leaf cuttings: You can also propagate Aloe vera using leaf cuttings. Cut a healthy leaf from the parent plant, making sure to get a clean cut at the base of the leaf. Let the cut end of the leaf callus over for a day or two, then plant it in a small pot with well-draining soil. Water it lightly and place it in bright, indirect sunlight. After a few weeks, the leaf should start to root and a new plant will begin to grow.
