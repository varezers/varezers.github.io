Planting: Ghost Peppers require warm soil and full sun, so choose a spot that receives at least 6 hours of sunlight per day. Plant them in well-draining soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5. You can start the seeds indoors 8-10 weeks before the last frost, or sow them directly in the ground after the danger of frost has passed.

Watering: Ghost Peppers require moderate watering. Water deeply once or twice a week, depending on weather conditions. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot.

Fertilizing: Fertilize Ghost Peppers once a month during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer.

Pruning: Ghost Peppers can become bushy, so pruning is important. Pinch off any side shoots and prune the plant to maintain a compact shape.

Harvesting: Ghost Peppers take about 100-120 days to mature. Harvest the peppers when they are fully ripe, usually when they turn red. Wear gloves when handling the peppers, as they are extremely hot.

Propagation: Ghost Peppers can be propagated by seed or by taking stem cuttings. To take stem cuttings, select a healthy stem and cut a section that is about 3-4 inches long. Dip the cut end in rooting hormone, and plant it in a well-draining potting mix. Keep the soil moist and place the cutting in a warm, bright spot. It should root within a few weeks.
