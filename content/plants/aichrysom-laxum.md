Temperature: 20-25

Light: Achrysum laxum thrives in full sun to partial shade. It can tolerate some shade, but too much shade can cause the plant to become leggy and not flower as much.

Water: Achrysum laxum prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, especially during the summer months. However, it is drought-tolerant and can survive extended periods without water.

Soil: Achrysum laxum prefers well-draining soil with a slightly acidic pH. You can add organic matter like compost to improve the soil's drainage and fertility.

Fertilizer: You can fertilize Achrysum laxum with a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).

Propagation: Achrysum laxum can be propagated by stem cuttings or seed.

Pruning: Prune your Achrysum laxum after the first flush of flowers to encourage new growth and more blooms. You can also deadhead spent flowers to prolong the flowering season.

Pests and diseases: Achrysum laxum is relatively pest and disease-free. However, watch out for spider mites, aphids, and powdery mildew. You can treat these problems with insecticidal soap or neem oil.

Stem cuttings: Take 4-6 inch stem cuttings from a healthy Achrysum laxum plant. Remove the lower leaves from the cutting, leaving only 1-2 pairs of leaves at the top. Dip the cut end of the stem in rooting hormone and plant the cutting in a pot with well-draining soil. Keep the soil moist and place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After a few weeks, roots should start to grow from the stem cutting. Once the roots are well-established, you can transplant the new plant to a larger pot or to the garden.

Seed propagation: You can also propagate Achrysum laxum from seed. Sow the seeds in a pot with well-draining soil in the spring, after the last frost. Cover the seeds lightly with soil and keep the soil moist. Place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After the seeds have germinated, thin out the weaker seedlings and transplant the stronger ones to their own pots or to the garden.

Is a perennial plant that is native to New Zealand.
