Light: Citrus lemon prefers full sun, at least 6-8 hours a day. It can also tolerate some shade, but this may affect fruit production.

Water: Citrus lemon needs regular watering, especially during the growing season (spring and summer). Keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.

Soil: Citrus lemon prefers well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. A mixture of sand, peat moss, and perlite can be a good option.

Fertilizer: Citrus lemon benefits from regular fertilization during the growing season. Use a citrus-specific fertilizer or a balanced fertilizer, following the manufacturer's instructions.

Pruning: Citrus lemon can benefit from occasional pruning to control its size and shape. Prune in the spring or summer, removing any dead or damaged branches, and cutting back any stems that have become too long or leggy.

Propagation:
* Seed: Citrus lemon can be propagated from seed. Collect fresh lemon seeds and plant them in well-draining soil, covering them with a thin layer of soil. Keep the soil consistently moist and place the pot in a warm, bright location. Germination can take several weeks to several months.
* Cuttings: Citrus lemon can also be propagated from stem cuttings taken in the spring or summer. Cut a stem from the mother plant that is about 6-8 inches long and remove the lower leaves. Dip the end of the cutting in rooting hormone and plant it in well-draining soil. Cover the pot with a plastic bag to create a humid environment and place it in bright, indirect light. The cutting should develop roots and new growth in a few weeks.
