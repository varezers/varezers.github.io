Mangifera indica, commonly known as the mango tree, is a tropical fruit tree that is native to South Asia but is now widely cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world.

Climate: Mangifera indica requires a tropical or subtropical climate with a minimum temperature of 10-12°C (50-54°F) during the winter months.

Soil: The tree prefers well-drained soil with a pH of 5.5-7.5.

Watering: The tree requires regular watering, especially during the first two years of growth, but avoid overwatering as it can cause root rot.

Light: The tree prefers full sun exposure for optimal growth.

Propagation: Mangifera indica can be propagated from seeds or by grafting.

Seed Propagation:
* Collect the ripe mango fruit and remove the pulp from the seed. Wash the seed and allow it to dry in the shade for a few days. Plant the seed in a pot with well-drained soil, burying it up to its waist. Keep the soil moist and warm, and the seed should germinate in two to four weeks.
* Grafting: Grafting is a common method of propagating mango trees. The scion is taken from a desired cultivar and attached to the rootstock of a seedling or mature tree. Grafted trees can bear fruit within three to four years.
