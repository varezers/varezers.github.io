Planting: Cayenne pepper plants need warm soil and full sun. Choose a spot that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight per day. 

Plant the seeds indoors 8-10 weeks before the last frost, or sow them directly in the ground after the danger of frost has passed. Plant them in well-draining soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8.

Watering: Cayenne pepper plants require moderate watering. Water deeply once or twice a week, depending on weather conditions. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot.

Fertilizing: Fertilize cayenne pepper plants once a month during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer.

Pruning: Prune cayenne pepper plants to keep them compact and to encourage more fruit production. Pinch off any side shoots and prune the plant to maintain a bushy shape.

Harvesting: Cayenne peppers can be harvested when they are fully mature, usually when they are red. Wear gloves when harvesting the peppers, as they are hot.

Propagation: Cayenne peppers can be propagated by seed or by taking stem cuttings. To take stem cuttings, select a healthy stem and cut a section that is about 3-4 inches long. Dip the cut end in rooting hormone, and plant it in a well-draining potting mix. Keep the soil moist and place the cutting in a warm, bright spot. It should root within a few weeks.
