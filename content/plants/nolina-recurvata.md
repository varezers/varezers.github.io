Light: Nolina recurvata prefers bright, indirect light. It can also tolerate some direct sunlight, but too much can burn its leaves.

Water: Nolina recurvata is drought-tolerant and can go for long periods without water. Water deeply, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot.

Soil: Nolina recurvata prefers well-draining soil that is slightly acidic. A mixture of sand, peat moss, and perlite can be a good option.

Fertilizer: Nolina recurvata does not require much fertilizer. You can use a balanced fertilizer every few months during the growing season.

Pruning: Nolina recurvata does not require much pruning. Remove any dead or damaged leaves as needed.

Propagation:
1. Identify the pups: Nolina recurvata produces small offshoots or pups that grow from the base of the plant. These can be gently removed from the parent plant once they are a few inches tall.
2. Plant the pups: Plant the pups in well-draining soil and water them lightly. Keep them in a warm, bright location, but out of direct sunlight.
3. Care for the pups: Water the pups sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Once the pups have established roots and have grown a few inches, they can be treated like mature Nolina recurvata plants.
