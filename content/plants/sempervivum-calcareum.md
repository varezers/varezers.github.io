Light: Sempervivum calcareum prefers full sun to partial shade.

Water: Sempervivum calcareum is drought-tolerant and only needs to be watered when the soil is completely dry. Overwatering can cause root rot, so make sure the soil has good drainage.

Soil: Sempervivum calcareum prefers well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. You can amend the soil with sand or perlite to improve its drainage.

Temperature: Sempervivum calcareum can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, but it prefers cool temperatures between 60째F and 75째F (15째C to 24째C).

Fertilizer: Sempervivum calcareum does not need fertilizer, but you can apply a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer) to promote healthy growth.

Pruning: Sempervivum calcareum does not require pruning, but you can remove any dead leaves or offsets to maintain its appearance.

Propagation:
* Offsets: One of the easiest ways to propagate Sempervivum calcareum is by using its offsets. These are small plantlets that grow from the mother plant. Wait until the offsets are at least one-third the size of the mother plant before removing them. Carefully separate the offsets from the mother plant and plant them in a pot or in the garden. Water lightly and keep the soil moist until the offsets establish roots.
* Leaf cuttings: You can also propagate Sempervivum calcareum from leaf cuttings. Cut a healthy leaf from the mother plant and let it callus over for a few days. Then plant the leaf in well-draining soil, burying the bottom half of the leaf. Water lightly and keep the soil moist until the leaf develops roots and a new plantlet emerges.
