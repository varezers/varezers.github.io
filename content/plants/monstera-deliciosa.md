Light: Monstera deliciosa prefers bright, indirect sunlight but can tolerate some shade. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves.

Water: Water Monstera deliciosa when the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. Use a well-draining soil and a pot with drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating at the bottom.

Soil: Monstera deliciosa prefers a rich, well-draining soil with good aeration. You can use a commercial potting mix or make your own by combining equal parts of peat moss, perlite, and coarse sand.

Temperature: Monstera deliciosa prefers warm temperatures between 65째F and 80째F (18째C to 27째C). Keep it away from drafts and sudden temperature changes.

Fertilizer: Monstera deliciosa benefits from regular fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) to promote healthy growth. Use a balanced fertilizer every two weeks or a slow-release fertilizer every two to three months.

Pruning: Monstera deliciosa can become unruly over time, so you can prune it to maintain its shape and encourage bushier growth. Use sharp, clean scissors to cut back the stems and remove dead or yellowing leaves.

Propagation:
* Stem cuttings: One of the easiest ways to propagate Monstera deliciosa is by using stem cuttings. Cut a healthy stem from the mother plant that has at least one aerial root and one node (a small bump where the leaf meets the stem). Place the cutting in water or well-draining soil, burying the node below the soil level. Keep the soil moist and provide bright, indirect light. After a few weeks, the cutting will develop roots and new growth.
* Air layering: You can also propagate Monstera deliciosa by air layering, which involves making a small cut in a stem and wrapping it in moist sphagnum moss or peat moss. Cover the moss with plastic wrap and secure it with twine or tape. After a few weeks, the stem will develop roots and new growth. Cut the stem below the air layer and plant it in well-draining soil.
