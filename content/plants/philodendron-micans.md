Fertilizer: Philodendron Micans with a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).

Pruning: Pinch back the tips of the vines to encourage bushier growth, and trim any yellow or dead leaves as needed.

Repotting: Repot your Philodendron Micans every two years or when the roots start to outgrow the pot.
