Propagation:
* Division: One of the easiest ways to propagate Chlorophytum comosum 'Jacqueline' is by division. When your plant becomes too large for its pot, you can divide it into smaller plants. Carefully remove the plant from its pot and gently separate the plantlets at the base. Each new plant should have some roots and a few leaves. Plant the new plants in pots with well-draining soil and water them lightly.
* Stem cuttings: You can also propagate Chlorophytum comosum 'Jacqueline' using stem cuttings. Cut a stem to the desired length, making sure the cutting has at least a few leaves and a node. Place the cutting in a glass of water or in a pot with moist, well-draining soil. Keep the cutting in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After a few weeks, roots should start to grow from the stem cutting. Once the roots are well-established, you can transplant the new plant to a larger pot.
