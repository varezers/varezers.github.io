Light: Pilea peperomioides prefers bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, while too little light can cause the plant to become leggy.

Water: Water your Pilea peperomioides when the top inch of soil feels dry. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so make sure the soil is well-draining and not waterlogged.

Humidity: Pilea peperomioides likes moderate humidity, so consider placing a tray of water near the plant or misting the leaves regularly.

Temperature: Pilea peperomioides prefers temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C).

Soil: Use a well-draining potting mix with perlite, vermiculite, or sand.

Fertilizer: Feed your Pilea peperomioides with a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).

Pruning: Pinch back the tips of the stems to encourage bushier growth, and trim any yellow or dead leaves as needed.

Repotting: Repot your Pilea peperomioides every two years or when the roots start to outgrow the pot.

Pests: Check your plant regularly for pests like spider mites or mealybugs, and treat them promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.

Propagation: Pilea peperomioides can be propagated through stem cuttings or by separating the plantlets that form around the base of the plant
