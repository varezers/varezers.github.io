Light: Crassula ovata prefers bright, indirect sunlight but can also tolerate some direct sunlight. Place it near a window that gets at least four hours of sunlight a day.

Water: Crassula ovata is drought-tolerant and only needs to be watered when the soil is completely dry. Overwatering can cause root rot, so make sure the soil has good drainage. Water less frequently during the winter when the plant is dormant.

Soil: Crassula ovata prefers well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. You can use a cactus or succulent soil mix or amend regular potting soil with sand or perlite to improve drainage.

Temperature: Crassula ovata can tolerate a wide range of temperatures but prefers warm temperatures between 65째F and 75째F (18째C to 24째C).

Fertilizer: Crassula ovata does not need fertilizer but can benefit from a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer) to promote healthy growth.

Pruning: Crassula ovata can become leggy over time, so you can prune it to maintain its shape and encourage bushier growth. Use sharp, clean scissors to cut back the stems to a desired length.

Propagation:
* Stem cuttings: One of the easiest ways to propagate Crassula ovata is by using stem cuttings. Cut a healthy stem from the mother plant and let it callus over for a few days. Then plant the stem cutting in well-draining soil, burying the bottom one-third of the stem. Water lightly and keep the soil moist until the cutting develops roots and new growth emerges.
* Leaf cuttings: You can also propagate Crassula ovata from leaf cuttings. Remove a healthy leaf from the mother plant and let it callus over for a few days. Then plant the leaf cutting in well-draining soil, burying the bottom half of the leaf. Water lightly and keep the soil moist until the leaf develops roots and a new plantlet emerges.
