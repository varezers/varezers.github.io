Light: Ficus elastica prefers bright, indirect light, but can also tolerate some shade. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves.

Water: Water your Ficus elastica when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Be sure not to overwater, as this can cause root rot. Allow excess water to drain away from the pot.

Soil: Ficus elastica prefers well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. A mixture of peat moss, perlite, and sand can be a good option.

Fertilizer: Ficus elastica benefits from regular fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer). Use a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month, following the manufacturer's instructions.

Pruning: Ficus elastica can benefit from regular pruning to control its size and shape. Prune in the spring or summer, removing any dead or damaged leaves, and cutting back any stems that have become too long or leggy.

Propagation:
* Stem cuttings: Ficus elastica can be propagated from stem cuttings taken in the spring or summer. Cut a stem from the mother plant that is about 6 inches long and remove the lower leaves. Dip the end of the cutting in rooting hormone and plant it in well-draining soil. Cover the pot with a plastic bag to create a humid environment and place it in bright, indirect light. The cutting should develop roots and new growth in a few weeks.
* Air layering: Air layering is another method for propagating Ficus elastica. Choose a healthy stem and make a small cut in the bark. Place a toothpick or piece of wire in the cut to keep it open, and wrap the area with damp sphagnum moss. Cover the moss with plastic wrap and secure it with tape. Roots should develop within a few weeks. Cut the stem below the rooted area and plant it in well-draining soil.
