Water: Water your Heuchera sanguinea regularly, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged. Make sure the soil has good drainage to prevent root rot.

Soil: Heuchera sanguinea prefers well-draining, fertile soil. You can amend the soil with organic matter like compost or aged manure to improve its texture and fertility.

Temperature: Heuchera sanguinea can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, but it prefers cool temperatures between 50째F and 70째F (10째C to 21째C).

Fertilizer: You can fertilize your Heuchera sanguinea with a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).

Pruning: Prune your Heuchera sanguinea to remove any dead or damaged leaves and to control its size and shape.

Propagation:
* Division: One of the easiest ways to propagate Heuchera sanguinea is by dividing the plant. Wait until the plant is at least three years old and has become crowded. In early spring or fall, carefully dig up the plant and separate the clumps into smaller sections with a sharp knife or spade. Each section should have at least one healthy crown and a few roots. Replant the sections in well-draining soil and water them lightly.
* Seed: You can also propagate Heuchera sanguinea from seed. Collect the seeds from the plant in late summer or early fall, and sow them in a tray or pot filled with well-draining soil. Cover the seeds lightly with soil and keep the tray or pot in a cool, shady spot. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. After a few weeks, the seeds should germinate, and you can transplant the seedlings to their own pots or into the garden.
