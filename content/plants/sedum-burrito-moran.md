Is a trailing succulent with long, thin stems covered in small, plump leaves

Light: Sedum burrito 'Moran' prefers bright, indirect light. It can tolerate some direct sunlight, but too much can scorch the leaves.

Water: Sedum burrito 'Moran' is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil. Water it sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot.

Soil: Sedum burrito 'Moran' prefers a well-draining soil mix, such as a cactus or succulent mix.

Fertilizer: Sedum burrito 'Moran' does not require much fertilizer. You can fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).

Pruning: Prune your Sedum burrito 'Moran' to control its size and shape. It can also be pruned to promote bushier growth.

Propagation:
* Stem cuttings: Take stem cuttings from a healthy Sedum burrito 'Moran' plant. Cut a stem to the desired length, making sure the cutting has at least two nodes. Allow the cutting to dry and callus over for a few days. Then, dip the cut end of the stem in rooting hormone and plant the cutting in a pot with well-draining soil. Keep the soil moist and place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After a few weeks, roots should start to grow from the stem cutting. Once the roots are well-established, you can transplant the new plant to a larger pot or to the garden.
* Leaf cuttings: You can also propagate Sedum burrito 'Moran' using leaf cuttings. Gently remove a leaf from the plant and let it dry for a few days until a callus forms on the cut end. Then, place the leaf on top of moist, well-draining soil and lightly cover the cut end with soil. Keep the soil moist and place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After a few weeks, a new plantlet should start to grow from the base of the leaf. Once the plantlet has developed roots and a few leaves, you can transplant it to a larger pot or to the garden.
