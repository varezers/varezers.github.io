I feel that most people have "fitting in" phase in their life on their journey to maturity. I never had one. Ever since first time I was called *weird* I decided to lean into it and it has proven to be a great, often painful, but always worthwhile asset.

Or so they say.

Besides the pure joy of operating on edge of acceptable it did bring me into many times of trouble. But as in every tragedy one finds one's own way to move on.

In a world where everybody is a main character somebody has to be the background, the **Non playable character**. Let's assume it is some job one has no motivation to fit in or make friends but decides to make do. One time before being called into HR void for being truthful or saying something innocent that was misunderstood in a weird way anti-capitalist one decides to take a backseat and be the background.

The idea is to become as generic, unremarkable and not worth remembering as possible —— a non playable character! I did not find anything online about being unremarkable. Quite the opposite — becoming "*Main character*", the wolf of wall street, hustle culture. So I want to reverse engineer an NPC.

## It doesn't have to be a style change!
We all hate it but people do judge book by its cover and decide vibe in first seven seconds. Luckily NPC's don't need to be *Dad core* come in all different flavours and colours, and don't have top [gray man](//trueprepper.com/gray-man/).

First impressions (trustworthiness, competence, likability, aggressiveness) are made in seven seconds and due to belief perseverance can be quite sticky!

* Health: Clear skin and symmetry are often subconsciously linked to a strong immune system.
* Posture: Standing tall (occupying more space) signals high testosterone and lower cortisol, which we read as confidence and leadership.
* Clothing: We use attire as a proxy for socioeconomic status. Research shows people are more likely to follow a jaywalker wearing a suit than one wearing a t-shirt.

On the contrary it is important to just look safe —— clean. That is a simple rule to follow.

If any fashion related topics arise - you picked it up from a second hand store.

## It is all about communication!
In-game NPC's can even have extreme opinions but lack agency —— the critical thought behind their opinions. Physically present yet mentally on autopilot. Ideally no controversial, and definitely no passionate backing. But it is much simpler if you pretend to not have any opinion outside of your audience.

The most prominent character of IRL NPC is to never ask any questions. Remember that you are designing a safe persona to never attract any attention. Never ask anything beyond *"How are you"*, and *you* are always *fine*! Your hobbies is something boring you know enough about but don't care anymore —— football, old TV shows, gym (especially if you ain't good at it), video game you're stuck on since 2016.

When asked pretty much anything —— you are *okay* and never entertain your foe with questions.

Whenever something shockings comes up —— "*That's crazy*", "*it is what it is*", "*I didn't think about it*", "*That's cool*", "*Makes sense*" —— are very legit responses!

You always "*done chores, did laundry, really passionate abot cleaning house*".

You never have an opinion where to eat. But do everything to avoid unnecessary interactions —— bring your own boring lunch.

If you ever are spotted in an interesting activity outside of office —— your friends invited you to for a day out.

Remember that every verbalised idea most probably will become your responsibility.

Always remember to have a second or two lag before response.

### Non-verbal communication
* Avoid direct eye contact.
* When laughing people to tend to look their favourite sin the eyes —— do your best to never have any fav colleague!
* Learn to control or minimise your movements.
* When in doubt —— look sad. Or deep on the phone works too.
* Walk with purpose —— carry something stupid —— a briefcase, a file clip, a bag. Subconsciously people will more likely to remember "*a man with a bag*" rather than man himself.
* Conserve your energy for things that matter to you —— outside if the office.
* Look dumb and kind —— I learned that from nearly any Finn that tried to do somethingb shady (often successfully).

These are very simple yet solid ways how to avoid unnecessary attention in places you need to fit in.

Good luck!
