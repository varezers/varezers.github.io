Congratulations on reaching top of Maslov's hierarchy of needs, even if you decided to skip a few layers. But to be fair to painting - it is extremely therapeutic, interesting and one more creative way to annoy people with some unnecessarily personal gifts.

The hobby in itself might seem forbiddingly expensive but in reality a lot of fun can be squeezed out of the tube of paint.

## Tools & consumables
**Surface** - depends on viscosity of a medium. Generally canvas or panels for oil and acrylics, different weight and thickness paper for everything else.

**Primer/Gesso** - needs to be applied to surfaces before painting with oil and acrylics. Just two coats an hour apart are perfectly workable after overnight. Some sanding might be required;

**Brushes/tools** - much ink has been spilled over preferred brushes. But in real life *(from all the research I've done)* that is just a preference. Generally:
	* Synthetic brushes are harder and will leave visible marks good for harshing up the consistency;
	* Animal hair brushes are soft and great for leaving minimal trace;
	* Painting knife - generally multitool of the industry - can palette knife to mix paint or to finish whole painting. These come in different shapes and sizes, all of soft, flexible metal. I prefer asymmetric copies for their versatility;

These are consumables and their cheapness make no lasting difference. I find cheapest of the bunch to lose bristles on the surface which, frankly, sucks, but somewhat can be helped with a few drops of glue.

Besides a large and a medium brush of both synthetic and natural bristles I find fan brush and a large "utility" brush really useful. I would recommend to own tiny natural bristle brush but painting knife does the job at precision a lot better.

**Paint** - Choose only "artist" or "professional" labeled paints as cheaper ones have no "archivability" and will definitely brown much quicker. No need for all of them - they are supposed to be mixed. [If fourteen is enough for Bob Ross's favourites](//www.bobross.com/product-p/r135.htm) then it is enough for everybody. I have began with monochromatic paintings for which one colour, a white and a black are enough.

**How to read paint information** - usually tubes of paint will contain following on them:

* Material - oil, acrylic, etc. They don't usually mix together at all;

* Colour - not only digitally imprinted approximation of it but also name, colour index.

* Opacity - usually a stripe or a square either solid or semi-covered;

**Palette** - for oil and acrylic the *%insert_niche_luxury_brand_of_choice_here%* is a glass picture frame which can be had for a few cents in local charity shop;

**Easel** - in most cases floor or tape is good enough, but with only a little investment in cheap pine planks and a little consumables one can make banger easel. I made just two planks one next to another with gap in between for screw tightening mechanism and installed it to a wardrobe since I am short on wall space;

## Tips and tricks to suck less

* **Learn [colour harmony](//www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/)**;

* Learn to **see shadows**. Do monochromatic photography, watch monochromatic film. Look for shades, shadow fall, shadow harshness in different light, shadow texture and contour, how shadow impacts colour and surrounding colour impacts thing in shadow;

* **Subscribe to artists whose work you enjoy**, people who inspire you, sub to hashtags you want to see more of;

* Don't be perfectionist. **Fail better - learn from it**, simplify, claim "impressionism". One is not supposed to capture reality but rather the essence of subject;

* Oil takes a **long time to dry**. One can expect generous amounts of paint to be still be liquid for next 24 hours. Some painting mediums have modified drying time to up to a week for me. Alternatively acrylic and watercolour dries quicker;

* **Surfaces** - canvas or panel. Pretty much anything that can be primed can be used for painting, but I prefer small panels. Panels appeal to me with portability and utilitarian simplicity. Some surfaces may be already primed. Watercolours have special thick paper;

* **Oil paint can be rubbed off in a rag or dissolved in white spirit** - it will not mix with water at all, unlike any other kind;

* Reckless amount of **leftover oil paint can be stored indefinitely** in film canisters sealed from air by water and stored in a fridge. Any container that can hold water will do. To use it gain just pop out of the fridge an hour before use;

* Never mix **more medium than 1:1**. It will crack and make dried paint brown quicker;

* **Varnish** oil and acrylic painting to protect it for longer;

* Don't mix **vehicles** - acrylic, oil, watercolour doesn't mix;

* There is no shame in **using reference pictures**;

* **Present your work** preferably in adequate 5500 Kelvin light. If posting online add some related objects of interest and don't cheap on background surface - some cheap palette wood is enough to look rustic and fancy;

* **Write guides and take notes - for reference and others to learn**. Trouble with most guides is that professionals forget hos to be novice and how it feels to begin new skill;
