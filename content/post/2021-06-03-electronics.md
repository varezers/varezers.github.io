# Glossary

* Alternating current (AC) - current that changes direction, your typical power outlet;
* Direct Current (DC) - one way current used in most electronics;

* Volts (v) - literally "pressure" of power;
* Current (amperage) (I) - literally "amount" of power;

* Resistance (Ohm) (r) - the relation property between voltage and current;

# Components

## Resistor
a piece of tubular material reisting n ohms. Resistance is measured in colour coded system of multiplied values and tolerance (accuracy).

## Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
Literally a tiny lightbulb.

All diodes have two legs:
* Anode (+) - the longer one;
* Cathode (-) - the shorter one, sometimes has flat bit;

## Switches

* Toggle switch - literally On/Off

# Equations

## Calculate resustance necessary for component
R = (Power soource voltage - component voltage) / components amperage;

# Tools

* Small metal clamps - for fast prototyping, tetsing, holding things together;
* Neeldenose pliers - just a do-it-all tool that does nothing well. I looked for plier, wire stripping, cutting and crimping together. Actually does all I need;
* Wire cutter - specific tool to remove insulation from wires;
* Bread board - a basic board to hold prototyping components;
* Electronic insulation tape - a consumable to isolate different wires;
* Multimeter - most important tool to measure different values;
