  <p>Congratulations on reaching top of Maslov&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs, even if you decided to skip a few layers. But to be fair to painting - it is extremely therapeutic, interesting and one more creative way to annoy people with some unnecessarily personal gifts.</p>
<p>The hobby in itself might seem forbiddingly expensive but in reality a lot of fun can be squeezed out of the tube of paint.</p>
<h2 id="tools--consumables">Tools &amp; consumables</h2>
<p><strong>Surface</strong> - depends on viscosity of a medium. Generally canvas or panels for oil and acrylics, different weight and thickness paper for everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Primer/Gesso</strong> - needs to be applied to surfaces before painting with oil and acrylics. Just two coats an hour apart are perfectly workable after overnight. Some sanding might be required;</p>
<p><strong>Brushes/tools</strong> - much ink has been spilled over preferred brushes. But in real life <em>(from all the research I&rsquo;ve done)</em> that is just a preference. Generally:
* Synthetic brushes are harder and will leave visible marks good for harshing up the consistency;
* Animal hair brushes are soft and great for leaving minimal trace;
* Painting knife - generally multitool of the industry - can palette knife to mix paint or to finish whole painting. These come in different shapes and sizes, all of soft, flexible metal. I prefer asymmetric copies for their versatility;</p>
<p>These are consumables and their cheapness make no lasting difference. I find cheapest of the bunch to lose bristles on the surface which, frankly, sucks, but somewhat can be helped with a few drops of glue.</p>
<p>Besides a large and a medium brush of both synthetic and natural bristles I find fan brush and a large &ldquo;utility&rdquo; brush really useful. I would recommend to own tiny natural bristle brush but painting knife does the job at precision a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>Paint</strong> - Choose only &ldquo;artist&rdquo; or &ldquo;professional&rdquo; labeled paints as cheaper ones have no &ldquo;archivability&rdquo; and will definitely brown much quicker. Some non-artist paints I got are not solid enough, come with separated oil from pygment, apply in a very liquid manner. No need for all different colours - they are supposed to be mixed. <a href="//www.bobross.com/product-p/r135.htm">If fourteen is enough for Bob Ross&rsquo;s favourites</a> then it is enough for everybody. I have began with monochromatic paintings for which one colour, a white and a black are enough.</p>
<p><strong>How to read paint information</strong> - usually tubes of paint will contain following on them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Material - oil, acrylic, etc. They don&rsquo;t usually mix together at all;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colour - not only digitally imprinted approximation of it but also name, colour index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opacity - usually a stripe or a square either solid or semi-covered;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Palette</strong> - for oil and acrylic the <em>%insert_niche_luxury_brand_of_choice_here%</em> is a glass picture frame which can be had for a few cents in local charity shop;</p>
<p><strong>Easel</strong> - in most cases floor or tape is good enough, but with only a little investment in cheap pine planks and a little consumables one can make banger easel. I made just two planks one next to another with gap in between for screw tightening mechanism and installed it to a wardrobe since I am short on wall space;</p>
<h2 id="tips-and-tricks-to-suck-less">Tips and tricks to suck less</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn <a href="//www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/">colour harmony</a></strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to <strong>see shadows</strong>. Do monochromatic photography, watch monochromatic film. Look for shades, shadow fall, shadow harshness in different light, shadow texture and contour, how shadow impacts colour and surrounding colour impacts thing in shadow;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subscribe to artists whose work you enjoy</strong>, people who inspire you, sub to hashtags you want to see more of;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be perfectionist. <strong>Fail better - learn from it</strong>, simplify, claim &ldquo;impressionism&rdquo;. One is not supposed to capture reality but rather the essence of subject;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oil takes a <strong>long time to dry</strong>. One can expect generous amounts of paint to be still be liquid for next 24 hours. Some painting mediums have modified drying time to up to a week for me. Alternatively acrylic and watercolour dries quicker;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Surfaces</strong> - canvas or panel. Pretty much anything that can be primed can be used for painting, but I prefer small panels. Panels appeal to me with portability and utilitarian simplicity. Some surfaces may be already primed. Watercolours have special thick paper;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oil paint can be rubbed off in a rag or dissolved in white spirit</strong> - it will not mix with water at all, unlike any other kind;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reckless amount of <strong>leftover oil paint can be stored indefinitely</strong> in film canisters sealed from air by water and stored in a fridge. Any container that can hold water will do. To use it gain just pop out of the fridge an hour before use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never mix <strong>more medium than 1:1</strong>. It will crack and make dried paint brown quicker;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Varnish</strong> oil and acrylic painting to protect it for longer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mix <strong>vehicles</strong> - acrylic, oil, watercolour doesn&rsquo;t mix;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no shame in <strong>using reference pictures</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Present your work</strong> preferably in adequate 5500 Kelvin light. If posting online add some related objects of interest and don&rsquo;t cheap on background surface - some cheap palette wood is enough to look rustic and fancy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write guides and take notes - for reference and others to learn</strong>. Trouble with most guides is that professionals forget hos to be novice and how it feels to begin new skill;</p>
