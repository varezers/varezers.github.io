    <h2>Aichrysom Laxum</h2>
    
      <h3>Golden carpet</h3>
    
  </header>

  <p>Temperature: 20-25</p>
<p>Light: Achrysum laxum thrives in full sun to partial shade. It can tolerate some shade, but too much shade can cause the plant to become leggy and not flower as much.</p>
<p>Water: Achrysum laxum prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, especially during the summer months. However, it is drought-tolerant and can survive extended periods without water.</p>
<p>Soil: Achrysum laxum prefers well-draining soil with a slightly acidic pH. You can add organic matter like compost to improve the soil&rsquo;s drainage and fertility.</p>
<p>Fertilizer: You can fertilize Achrysum laxum with a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).</p>
<p>Propagation: Achrysum laxum can be propagated by stem cuttings or seed.</p>
<p>Pruning: Prune your Achrysum laxum after the first flush of flowers to encourage new growth and more blooms. You can also deadhead spent flowers to prolong the flowering season.</p>
<p>Pests and diseases: Achrysum laxum is relatively pest and disease-free. However, watch out for spider mites, aphids, and powdery mildew. You can treat these problems with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
<p>Stem cuttings: Take 4-6 inch stem cuttings from a healthy Achrysum laxum plant. Remove the lower leaves from the cutting, leaving only 1-2 pairs of leaves at the top. Dip the cut end of the stem in rooting hormone and plant the cutting in a pot with well-draining soil. Keep the soil moist and place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After a few weeks, roots should start to grow from the stem cutting. Once the roots are well-established, you can transplant the new plant to a larger pot or to the garden.</p>
<p>Seed propagation: You can also propagate Achrysum laxum from seed. Sow the seeds in a pot with well-draining soil in the spring, after the last frost. Cover the seeds lightly with soil and keep the soil moist. Place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After the seeds have germinated, thin out the weaker seedlings and transplant the stronger ones to their own pots or to the garden.</p>
<p>Is a perennial plant that is native to New Zealand.</p>

<p>Pruning: Prune your Aloe vera to remove any dead or damaged leaves and to control its size and shape.</p>
<p>Propagation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pups: One of the easiest ways to propagate Aloe vera is by using its offsets, also known as &ldquo;pups.&rdquo; When your Aloe vera plant produces offsets, wait until they are about one-third the size of the parent plant before removing them. Gently remove the pup from the parent plant and let the wound callus over for a day or two. Then plant the pup in a small pot with well-draining soil and water it lightly. Wait a few weeks for the roots to establish before transplanting the new plant to a larger pot.</li>
<li>Leaf cuttings: You can also propagate Aloe vera using leaf cuttings. Cut a healthy leaf from the parent plant, making sure to get a clean cut at the base of the leaf. Let the cut end of the leaf callus over for a day or two, then plant it in a small pot with well-draining soil. Water it lightly and place it in bright, indirect sunlight. After a few weeks, the leaf should start to root and a new plant will begin to grow.</li>

    <h2>Sedum burrito &#39;Moran&#39;</h2>
    
      <h3>Donkey tale sedum</h3>
    
  </header>

  <p>Is a trailing succulent with long, thin stems covered in small, plump leaves</p>
<p>Light: Sedum burrito &lsquo;Moran&rsquo; prefers bright, indirect light. It can tolerate some direct sunlight, but too much can scorch the leaves.</p>
<p>Water: Sedum burrito &lsquo;Moran&rsquo; is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil. Water it sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot.</p>
<p>Soil: Sedum burrito &lsquo;Moran&rsquo; prefers a well-draining soil mix, such as a cactus or succulent mix.</p>
<p>Fertilizer: Sedum burrito &lsquo;Moran&rsquo; does not require much fertilizer. You can fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).</p>
<p>Pruning: Prune your Sedum burrito &lsquo;Moran&rsquo; to control its size and shape. It can also be pruned to promote bushier growth.</p>
<p>Propagation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stem cuttings: Take stem cuttings from a healthy Sedum burrito &lsquo;Moran&rsquo; plant. Cut a stem to the desired length, making sure the cutting has at least two nodes. Allow the cutting to dry and callus over for a few days. Then, dip the cut end of the stem in rooting hormone and plant the cutting in a pot with well-draining soil. Keep the soil moist and place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After a few weeks, roots should start to grow from the stem cutting. Once the roots are well-established, you can transplant the new plant to a larger pot or to the garden.</li>
<li>Leaf cuttings: You can also propagate Sedum burrito &lsquo;Moran&rsquo; using leaf cuttings. Gently remove a leaf from the plant and let it dry for a few days until a callus forms on the cut end. Then, place the leaf on top of moist, well-draining soil and lightly cover the cut end with soil. Keep the soil moist and place the pot in a bright, warm area, but out of direct sunlight. After a few weeks, a new plantlet should start to grow from the base of the leaf. Once the plantlet has developed roots and a few leaves, you can transplant it to a larger pot or to the garden.</li>

    <h2>Sempervivum calcareum</h2>
    
      <h3></h3>
    
  </header>

  <p>Light: Sempervivum calcareum prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Water: Sempervivum calcareum is drought-tolerant and only needs to be watered when the soil is completely dry. Overwatering can cause root rot, so make sure the soil has good drainage.</p>
<p>Soil: Sempervivum calcareum prefers well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. You can amend the soil with sand or perlite to improve its drainage.</p>
<p>Temperature: Sempervivum calcareum can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, but it prefers cool temperatures between 60°F and 75°F (15°C to 24°C).</p>
<p>Fertilizer: Sempervivum calcareum does not need fertilizer, but you can apply a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer) to promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>Pruning: Sempervivum calcareum does not require pruning, but you can remove any dead leaves or offsets to maintain its appearance.</p>
<p>Propagation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offsets: One of the easiest ways to propagate Sempervivum calcareum is by using its offsets. These are small plantlets that grow from the mother plant. Wait until the offsets are at least one-third the size of the mother plant before removing them. Carefully separate the offsets from the mother plant and plant them in a pot or in the garden. Water lightly and keep the soil moist until the offsets establish roots.</li>
<li>Leaf cuttings: You can also propagate Sempervivum calcareum from leaf cuttings. Cut a healthy leaf from the mother plant and let it callus over for a few days. Then plant the leaf in well-draining soil, burying the bottom half of the leaf. Water lightly and keep the soil moist until the leaf develops roots and a new plantlet emerges.</li>
