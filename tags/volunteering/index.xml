      <description>This is my personal recollection on my eight months spent in Romania, supposedly volunteering for environmental project for NGO. The project promised non-stop work for environment, planting, cleaning, educating, meeting youngsters and promote green living, but I had to be very adamant to get what I have been promised. Many reasons prompted me to do this, but mostly all the nice and sugary stories of other people I have red so much on the internet.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If only one human from every group that visits this place will get inspired, then the world will be a better place&amp;rdquo; /Roger says watching the campfire
One lazy morning my friend Mariami rushes into my room and excitingly offers me a chance to visit Organic Art Ranch, &amp;ldquo;a place in the mountains where people do cool permaculture stuff&amp;rdquo; - can&amp;rsquo;t say no to that offer.
A week or so later, we set off to another daunting train Ride across quarter of Romania from Arad to Huedin, a village of 9000 people, where we pick up needed supplies we are expected to come with - some food and cardboard box.</description>
