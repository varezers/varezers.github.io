      <description>What is TDD Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed.
Benefits of TDD Better Code Quality - TDD encourages DRY and KISS principle - code which can be unit tested. Testable outcomes are simple and easy to understand; Maintainable code - it takes less effort to focus on smaller, managable chunks of code; Easier refactoring; Prevent bugs - writing a unit test may: uncover edge cases missed in planning requirements; forces code collaborators to not break previously agreed requirements of a code; forces to contribute new tests when new requirements are added over time; Documentation - unit tests are a documentation of how function is supposed to work and output.</description>
